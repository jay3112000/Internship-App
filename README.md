This my first Internship Project under Corlax.PVT.Ltd
This project is an E-commerce shop for Groceeries .It is based upon the idea that the stores can increase their sale and users can buy any shop item from their homes.
Project uses Flutter and Dart language and MVC architecture as a State Management tool

The system uses the users current location and automatically links to the nearest market available in the radius
